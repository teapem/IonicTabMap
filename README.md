# IonicTabMap

I found an excellent example for an Ionic App which opens up a Google Map at your current location for this week’s book club session.

It uses the Cordova Geolocation API - ngCordova which is a collection of 63+ AngularJS extensions on top of the Cordova API. 

The article http://www.gajotres.net/using-cordova-geoloacation-api-with-google-maps-in-ionic-framework/ shows you how to  download ngCordova install it and build the app 

The code itself on GitHub can be found at:

https://github.com/Gajotres/IonicGeolocationDemo

It works good. The only problem is that its geo-locating on Auckland (see screen shot below),  maybe that’s where our MIS server is located in this instance?

I tried to turn this into a tabbed application at https://github.com/teapem/IonicTabMap - the code is basically the same as the original  https://github.com/Gajotres/IonicGeolocationDemo except that the original is not tabbed. When I run it though all I get is a blank screen!
